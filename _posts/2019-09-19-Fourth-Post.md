# Structure of Kitchen Items: Classes 

The goal is to find a item in the kitchen and go into the structure of the object and determine how many classes (child, parent, etc) each object has.
When I went into my kitchen I saw a couple things out. There was a bowl, a blender, and banana bread.

The bowl's structure is: clay = ceramic = bowl. With the bowl we were able to see what different classes it contained. It starts off with clay and the clay is then shaped into a ceramic and the ceramic makes the bowl


The blender has different classes that can be seen. It starts of as the blender = blending element = electrical device. This can be seen when you use the object. The blender is the child. The blending element is the parent. Lastly the grandparent is electrical.
