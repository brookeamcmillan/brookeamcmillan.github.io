# Square to Rectangle is a bad example of class inheritance 
by Brooke McMillan


In class we learned about the Liskov Substitution. Which challenged the geometry sense that a sqaure is a rectangle. But from a object oriented perspective we have set the expectation that they are two different things.


The rectangle is limited to the subset the rectangles have set (subclasses). 

A important defenition to know, pertaining to this question:

Inheritance- Mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. The idea is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes.

We learn that a square is a bad example because squares and rectangle formulas differ and when you change one the other varies making that statement false. The formulas from a rectangle violates the Liskov Substitution principle.
